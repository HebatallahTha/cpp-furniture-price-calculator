# 🪑 C++ Furniture Price Calculator

This **C++ program** helps users calculate the cost of building custom furniture, including shelves and doors, using different types of wood. The user inputs their wood preference, number of shelves, and whether they want glass windowed doors. Based on these inputs, the program calculates the total price of the furniture.

## ✨ Features  
- 🌳 **Wood Selection**: Choose from three types of wood: Mahogany, Oak, or Pine.
- 📦 **Shelf Quantity**: Specify how many shelves you want for your furniture.
- 🚪 **Glass Windowed Doors**: Optionally choose glass windowed doors for your furniture.
- 💵 **Cost Calculation**: Automatically calculates the total cost based on wood type, shelves, and doors.
- 🚫 **Input Validation**: Ensures that the number of doors is not more than the number of shelves.
